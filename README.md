# Shortest Path Using Dijkstra's Algorithm

This project visualizes the shortest path finding process using Dijkstra's algorithm. It allows users to create nodes and edges on a canvas, assign weights to the edges, and find the shortest path from a source node to all other nodes.

## Features

- Create nodes by clicking on the canvas.
- Add edges between nodes with dynamically adjustable weights.
- Visualize the shortest path using Dijkstra's algorithm.
- Highlight the shortest path found.
- Reset the canvas to start over.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/shortest-path-dijkstra.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd shortest-path-dijkstra
    ```
3. Open `index.html` in your preferred web browser.

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in your web browser.
2. Click on the canvas to create nodes.
3. Click "Add edges" button to start adding edges between nodes.
4. Click on two nodes to create an edge between them.
5. Adjust edge weights by clicking on the displayed weight and editing it.
6. Enter the source node in the input box and click "Run" to find the shortest path.
7. The shortest path and cost will be displayed in the bottom panel.

## Instructions

1. Click anywhere on the screen to create a node.
2. After creating nodes, click the "Add edges" button to start adding edges.
3. Click on one node and then another to create an edge.
4. Each edge has a default weight based on the distance between nodes, which can be adjusted.
5. Enter the source node number in the input box and click "Run" to find the shortest path.
6. Ensure all weights are correctly set before running the algorithm.
